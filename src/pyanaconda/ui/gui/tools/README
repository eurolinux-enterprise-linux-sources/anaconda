This directory contains some tools that are helpful in developing the
anaconda UI.  They assume that you have an anaconda git tree checked out
(which you should if you're reading this), that you've run make in that
tree, and that you have the anaconda-widgets and anaconda-widgets-devel
packages installed.

Here's what you've got to work with:

run-spoke.py
------------
This program allows you to run a single GUI spoke on an installed system
without having to start up anaconda.  You do not have to be root to do this
and if you come across a situation where that ends up being a lie, it's a
bug in anaconda.  Please fix it.

This lets you very quickly make tweaks to your glade file and test it out
to see what things look like when some data is added, or check how buttons
and dialogs behave.  Often, there can be UI layout differences between how
things look in glade and how they look in reality.

To run, first modify the following lines:

    #from pyanaconda.ui.gui.spokes.software import SoftwareSelectionSpoke
    #spokeClass = SoftwareSelectionSpoke
    spokeClass = None

Uncomment the first two, changing "software" and "SoftwareSelectionSpoke" to
the names of the things you're testing, and then remove the third line.

Then, you run it like so (assuming you're in your home directory):

$ PYTHONPATH=src/anaconda:src/anaconda/pyanaconda/isys/.libs \
  UIPATH=src/anaconda/pyanaconda/ui/gui/ \
  src/anaconda/pyanaconda/ui/gui/tools/run-spoke.py

The $UIPATH environment variable ensures that you do not need to be anywhere
special when you run the program.  anaconda will be able to find your glade
file based on that.

run-hub.py
----------
This is the same as run-spoke.py, except it deals with hubs instead of spokes.
Because it deals with hubs, it also provides you with the ability to dive
down into individual spokes.  This is useful for making sure that the status,
apply, and setup methods of spokes work correctly.

Pressing the quit and continue buttons will immediately quit the program.
